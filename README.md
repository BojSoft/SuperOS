So i have created this OS to test my skills with coding
it is going well

:SUPEROS

This is an OS that runs inside of CMD in windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1

:requirements

above 1GHZ cpu speed

above 1GB ram
(gives around 500MB for Sound.exe which plays sounds for the os)

works best on windows 7

:negatives
this os has a lot if inserted images using Insertbmp.exe
so if you move the window at any time (this includes resizing) all of the images desplayed at the time will disappear



:lots of programs
lots of programs to choose from like paint or file explorer

all programs (v6A)

paint
file explorer
file copy
calc
cpu graph
Quickdraw
media player
BMP player
batchpad
file delete
disk mgr
image Viewer
search

i think that is all

Enjoy my code
